## 👨‍🌾 Garden

The [[garden/garden|garden]] represents notes on specific subjects that are meant to evolve over time. For instance, while I am learning `git` I might add a `git` page with a small collection of things that I want to remember. At any time if I want to add to that note, then I can. 

All notes in this section start off as 🌱[[garden/00-Seeds/seeds|seeds]] , as they evolve they can be upgraded to 🌲[[garden/01-Saplings/saplings|saplings]] , 🌴 [[garden/02-Trees/trees|trees]], and ultimately 🍍[[garden/03-Fruit/fruit|fruit]]. I got this idea from another persons digital garden a *really* long time ago. If I ever come across it again I will link it here.
